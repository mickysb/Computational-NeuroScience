<b>Question:</b>
```
Suppose that we have a neuron 
which, in a given time period, will fire with probability 0.1, 
yielding a Bernoulli distribution for the neuron's firing 
(denoted by the random variable F = 0 or 1) with P(F = 1) = 0.1. 

Which of these is closest to the entropy H(F) of this distribution 
(calculated in bits, i.e., using the base 2 logarithm)?

(i) 1.999
(ii) 0.1954
(iii) 0.4690
(iv) -0.1954
```

<b>Solution:</b>
(iii) 0.4690
