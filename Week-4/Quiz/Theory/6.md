Continued from <a href="https://github.com/ashumeow/Computational-NeuroScience/blob/master/Week-4/Quiz/Theory/5.md">Question 5</a>:
````
Now let's add a stimulus to the picture. 
Suppose that we think this neuron's activity is related to a light flashing in the eye. 
Let us say that the light is flashing in a given time period with probability 0.10. 
Call this stimulus random variable S.

If there is a flash, the neuron will fire with probability 1/2. 
If there is not a flash, the neuron will fire with probability 1/18. 
Call this random variable F (whether the neuron fires or not).

Which of these is closest, in bits (log base 2 units), to the mutual information MI(S,F)?

(Note: this question requires several calculations.)

(i) 0.0904
(ii) -0.3786
(iii) 0.8476
(iv) 0.3786
```


<b>Solution:</b>
(i) 0.0904
