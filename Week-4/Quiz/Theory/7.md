This math from lecture 4-3 could potentially be intimidating, but in fact the concept is really simple. 
Getting an intuition for it will help with many types of problems. 
Let's work out a metaphor to understand it.

Suppose we want to build a complex image. 
We could do that by layering a whole bunch of pieces together (mathematically - summing). 
This is like drawing on transparencies with various levels of opacity and putting them on top of each other. 
Those familiar with Photoshop or Gimp will recognize that concept. 
If we had to build an image in Photoshop with a bicycle on a road, 
for instance, perhaps we could have an image of a sky, and one of the road, and one of the bike. 
We could "add" these pieces together to make our target image.

Of course, if our neural system was trying to make visual fields that worked for any sort of input, 
we would want more than just roads, skies, and bikes to work with! 
One possibility is to have a bunch of generic shapes of various sizes, orientations, and locations within the image. 
If we chose the right variety, we could blend/sum these primitive pieces together to make just about any image! 
One way to blend them is to let them have varying transparencies/opacities, and to set them on top of each other. 
That is what we would call a weighted sum, where the weights are how transparent each piece is.

Of course, we may not want to have too many possible shapes to use. 
As mentioned in the video, the organism likely wants to conserve energy. 
That means having as few neurons firing as possible at once. 
If we conceptually make a correlation between these shapes and the neurons, 
then we can point out we would want to use as few shapes as we could while maintaining an accurate image.

This math gives us a way of summing a bunch of pieces together to represent an image, to attempt to make that representation look as much like the image as possible, 
and to make that representation efficient - using as few pieces as possible. 
That is a lot of work for two lines of math!

Now let's put this metaphor into action to understand what all these symbols mean. 
I'll give you one to start with. 
The vector x in the equation above represents the coordinates of a point in the image. 

Now you fill in the rest:

What do the Ï•is, called the "basis functions," represent in our metaphor?

(i) The importance of coding efficiency.
(ii) The level of transparency vs. opacity/influence of each piece.
(iii) The difference between the actual image and the representation.
(iv) The pieces that make up the image.
```


<b>Solution:</b>

(iv) The pieces that make up the image.
